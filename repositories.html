	<p> This GitHub repository was created for me to manage and keep track of my Processing projects, which are usually called sketches. It contains reproductions of known mathematical and scientific beauties, such as the Mandelbrot Set, and, of course, games. Those games can be found as built .exe files <a href=https://mega.nz/#F!pxcjia5Z!hKMl_mBoQbxlGeUgeqlIIQ>here</a>.</p>
