			<h1>Who I am</h1>
			<p> I'm a teenager, brazilian developer who tries to learn mathematical (and scientific) concepts through code. I started to learn how to program with <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming>Khan Academy</a>, which uses a JavaScript library based on <a href=https://processing.org/>Processing</a>, a programming language focused on visual arts.</p>
