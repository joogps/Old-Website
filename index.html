	<h1 style="margin-top:15px">About me</h1>
	<p> I'm a teenager, brazilian developer who tries to learn mathematical, artistic and scientific concepts through code. I started to learn programming with <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org>Khan Academy</a>, which uses a JavaScript library based on <a href=https://processing.org/>Processing</a>, a Java based programming language, to teach their students. In early 2018, I became interested on Processing itself and started to watch <a href=https://shiffman.net/>Daniel Shiffman</a>'s videos about it, which are available <a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman>here</a>. Since then I've programmed all of my ideas and wishes.</p>

	<h1>Processing</h1>
	<p> <a href=https://processing.org/>Processing</a> is a Java based open-source programming language and integrated development environment (which can be downloaded <a href=https://processing.org/download/>here</a>). It's used all arround the world with lots of different purposes and has led to many other projects, including <a href=http://p5js.org/>p5.js</a>, <a href=https://py.processing.org/>Processing.py</a> and <a href=http://processingjs.org/>Processing.js</a>. It was created in 2001 by Ben Fry and Casey Reas and has a main focus of encouraging people to learn art and mathematics at the same place, at the same time.
